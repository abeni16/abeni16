# 👋 Hey there, I'm Abenezer Asefa (Beni)

🚀 **Full Stack Developer | React & React Native Expert | Go & Node.js Backend Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub 👋
I build software that’s meant to last — reliable, practical, and focused on real users. My work ranges from mobile apps to complex multi-tenant systems, and I enjoy turning messy requirements into clean, scalable solutions. I’m especially drawn to solid architecture, thoughtful design, and experimenting with technologies that actually solve problems (not just look cool). If it improves performance, clarity, or developer sanity, I’m interested.
